1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
In an Express app, middleware are functions that modify or look at each request as it comes through.
Each middleware does a specific thing and then passes control to the next middleware by calling next()
until it reaches the final step where the response is sent.
In other words, middleware helps process incoming requests and prepare outgoing responses.
